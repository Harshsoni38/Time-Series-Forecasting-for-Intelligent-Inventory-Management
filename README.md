# Time Series Forecasting for Intelligent Inventory Management

> **One-line**: Python project that forecasts demand with time-series models and optimizes inventory decisions (reorder point, safety stock, order quantity) to minimize cost and stockouts.

---

## ‚ú® Highlights
- **Forecasting**: ARIMA/SARIMA (statsmodels) with auto seasonal detection, ACF/PACF diagnostics.
- **Inventory Optimization**: Reorder point, safety stock (service level), and order quantity with cost trade-offs.
- **Automation**: End-to-end pipeline (clean ‚Üí explore ‚Üí forecast ‚Üí optimize ‚Üí report).
- **Reproducibility**: Single config file + deterministic seeds.
- **Visualization**: Trend/seasonality plots, forecast vs. actuals, ACF/PACF, error curves.
